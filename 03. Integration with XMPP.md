# Integration with XMPP

Gurgle servers MAY optionally act as an XMPP server. It receives incoming XMPP messages and forwards to the corresponding Gurgle user, as well as receiving Gurgle messages and forwarding to the corresponding XMPP server.

## Referring an XMPP JID from Gurgle

When a Gurgle user tries to chat with an XMPP user. The following identification string is provided in place of Gurgle ID:

```
    xmpp:node@domain/resource
```

The syntax defines as the following:

```
    converted-JID = "xmpp:" original-JID
```

`original-JID` is an unescaped JID (without the processing explained in XEP-0106).

## Referring an Gurgle ID from XMPP

When an XMPP user tries to chat with a Gurgle user. The following identification string is provided in place of an XMPP JID.

```
    grgl:user@domain/terminal
```

The syntax defines as the following:

```
    converted-Gurgle-ID = "grgl:" original-Gurgle-ID
```

The converted Gurgle ID should be escaped according to the process explained in XEP-0106 before transporting. That is, "grgl:" is transformed to "grgl\3a".
