# Gurgle ID

Gurgle ID is an identification string for Gurgle user. It is much similar to an email address and an XMPP JID.

The following is an example of a valid Gurgle ID:

```
    grgl:user@domain/client
```

The syntax of Gurgle ID is defined as the following:

```
    Gurgle-ID       = [ "grgl:" ] username "@" domain [ "/" terminal ]
    domain          = FQDN / address-literal
    FQDN            = (sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain))
    address-literal = IPv4-address / IPv6-address
```

Each field MUST satisfy the "stringprep" protocol declared in RFC 3454. Each field MUST NOT contain whitespace codepoints.

`grgl:`, the protocol name of Gurgle ID. Usually it MAY be omitted, unless when a Gurgle user tries to chat with a user from another protocol such as XMPP.

`user`, the username of a Gurgle ID. In addition to "stringprep", U+002F (`/`) and U+0040 (`@`) are disallowed in `user` field. One Gurgle user MUST be assigned to at least one unique Gurgle ID. Gurgle service providers MAY redirect a request for `user+alias@domain` to `user@domain`, where `alias` is an arbitary string that keeps the whole Gurgle ID valid.

`domain`, the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) or IP address literal of the Gurgle service provider where the user is registered at. In addition to "stringprep", U+002F (`/`) and U+0040 (`@`) are disallowed in `domain` field.

`terminal`, a string to identify each terminal (or client software) the user uses to connect to the Gurgle network. Gurgle server SHOULD make sure multiple terminals of a same user are assigned with different `terminal` field.
