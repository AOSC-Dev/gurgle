# Transport stream

Gurgle uses a datagram-based protocol. Gurgle is designed to work on any transport media where a reliable datagram connection or stream connection can be kept between the client and the server.

## Types of data connections

The following four data connections may be used during a typical Gurgle session.

```
     +---------------+                   +---------------+
     | Gurgle server +-------------------+ Gurgle server |
     |  servera.net  |   S2S Connection  |  serverb.net  |
     +-------+-------+                   +-------+-------+
             |                                   |
             | P2S Connection                    | P2S Connection
             |                                   |
    +--------+---------+                +--------+---------+
    |   Gurgle user    |                |   Gurgle user    |
    | user@servera.net +----------------+ user@serverb.net |
    +------------------+ P2P Connection +------------------+
```

The figure above omitted the `terminal` field of Gurgle IDs since they are not related to this topic.

## Typical transport stream -- TCP/IP connection with TLS

With the consideration of reliability and security, the typical transport stream of Gurgle is TCP/IP connection with TLS.
